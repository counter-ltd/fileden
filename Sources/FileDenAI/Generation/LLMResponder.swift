    For totals, sums, and arithmetic: call `calculate`. \
    For finding the highest or lowest value in a list: call `find_min_max`, passing EVERY label:value \
    pair from the relevant column so nothing is missed — close values are easy to mis-read by eye. \

    formatting: <graph>{"type":"TYPE","title":"TITLE","labels":["Label1","Label2"],"values":[1.0,2.0]}</graph> \
    Supported types: "bar" for comparing categories, "pie" for proportions, "line" for trends. \
    Optional field "yMin": set this to the minimum Y-axis value when the user asks for an adaptive \
    or relative Y-axis (e.g. "start from the lowest value", "adaptive scale", "zoom in on differences"). \
    Set "yMin" to the smallest value in the dataset (or slightly below it) so small differences are visible. \
    Example with adaptive axis: <graph>{"type":"bar","title":"Monthly Income","labels":["Jan","Feb"],"values":[2800,2900],"yMin":2700}</graph> \
    IMPORTANT: Do NOT wrap it in ```json or any code block. Write the <graph> tag directly in \
    your response. You may add one sentence of context before or after. Output at most one graph tag.
